This application is built in NodeJS and needs your Discord User Token.
Don't know how to get your Discord User Token? [Click Here](https://github.com/TheRacingLion/Discord-SelfBot/wiki/Discord-Token-Tutorial)

To run this you need NodeJS installed.
[Click Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download NodeJS.

Download and Extract this .zip file. [DiscordCleaner.zip](https://github.com/OscarXcore/DiscordCleaner/releases/download/1.0/DiscordCleaner.zip)
Navigate to the directory where it was extracted to, click `File` at the top left corner of the file explorer (This is Windows 10 mainly), and choose `Open Windows Command Prompt` and type in the following, `node app.js {replace this with your Discord User Token without the brackets}` and then in Discord go to any text channel that you have the Manage Messages permission and type in `|clear|` or `|Clear|` and it will start clearing the channel.

To exit the application before it wipes the whole channel or if it does finish, make sure the Command Prompt window is in focus, then hold Control and then press C while holding Control. This kills the NodeJS process and therefore stopping the app.

Hope this makes your life easier in some situations! <3
